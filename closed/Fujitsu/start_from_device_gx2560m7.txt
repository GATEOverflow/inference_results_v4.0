Fujitsu's GX2560M7 system supports GPUDirect RDMA(TM) technology, which allows direct I/O from PCIe devices
to GPU device memory. This system has two NUMA nodes and each node has two H100 GPUs through PCIe Gen5x16
connection. The NUMA node can also be connected with network interface cards (NICs).

The system measured has Mellanox MT29908 ConnectX-6 which has two ports with 200Gb/s infiniband connector.
This corresponds to the throuput of 25GB/s per one port and 50GB/s per one card.

Resnet50-Offline runnig on this system, with INT8 input, requires to support 53GB/s and
can be run with the described network interfaces installed on the two NUMA nodes.
